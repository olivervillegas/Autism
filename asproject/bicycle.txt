This is another example article. This article will detail a bicycle. Bicycles are transportation vehicles that require a user to manipulate two pedals on either side of a narrow chassis in order to move forward. Usually, one learns to ride a bicycle with the help of training wheels at an early age. It is the primary mode of transportation for children and teenagers.

Bicycles are seen as a source of clean and sustainable transportation, as they do not require carbon-emitting fuel in order to function; bicycle usage does not pollute the air. There also exists electric bicycles, which are powered by electricity but still more environment-friendly than cars. Bicycles are also used to navigate the wilderness. Furthermore, stationary bicycles are often seen in gymnasiums; these machines allow one to exercise lower body muscles.

Overall, bicycles are efficient and healthy transportation options. Personally, I never learned how to ride a bicycle and to this day, I still do not know how to ride one. However, they seem like ideal transportation vehicles that also exercise your leg muscles upon use.
