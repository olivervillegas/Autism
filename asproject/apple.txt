This is an example article. This will detail an apple. An apple is a sweet red fruit that grows on trees. Well, it is usually red. Before ripening, it is green. Afterwards, it begins to turn yellow. Apples have a stem, which is usually brown, referred to as the core of the apple. There are also brown seeds inside.

Apple is also the brand name of a technology company founded by Steve Jobs. This company produces various technology appliances, from smartphones to headphones to pencils. Furthermore, apples represent a learning environment, commonly seen in American elementary schools as an object synonymous with a teacher.

There are different apple textures, some being softer than others. Overall, it is an enriching fruit filled with vital nutrients and makes for the perfect midday snack. Personally, I recommend it to be eaten with peanut butter; the peanut-based spread complements apples well.
